# Caius' Homebrew Tap

Caius puts things here to be able to tap them easily. Ideally they move upstream or die, so you might not want to depend on them in production.

## homebrew-jo

This repo used to be named `homebrew-jo`, but the formula for `jo` was accepted upstream into Homebrew itself. This tap is no longer required! Just `brew install jo` and you're good to go.
